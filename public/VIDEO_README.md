# Video Placeholder

To see the full effect of the Talent Core, place a video file named `preview.mp4` in the `/public` directory.

The video should be:
- Format: MP4
- Recommended size: 1080x1920 (vertical format)
- Duration: Any (it will loop)
- File size: Keep reasonable for web deployment

The application will work without the video file, showing colored panels instead.
